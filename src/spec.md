**Planned changes:**

- Update MINI GAME 3 — FIFA PENALTY SHOOTOUT copy to show "FINAL CHANCE TO SCORE", ask "What always wins her heart?", display the four provided choices, and make only "Efforts and showing up" trigger success text "GOAL!" and "GOAL SCORED IN JOSHI'S HEART".
- Adjust the Final Proposal pacing to show "MISSION COMPLETE" / "Solo mode finished.", then the beat text "Pause…" and "New mode?" before revealing "❤️ DUO MODE REQUEST ❤️" and its message (verbatim).
- Update the Ending/Achievement screen (after YES) to show "Achievement Unlocked", title "Valentine Partner 2026", the three reward lines exactly as written, and the final quote "Best matches are played with great teamwork." (verbatim).
- Add/render the 512x512 achievement badge image as a static asset at `frontend/public/assets/generated/valentine-achievement-badge.dim_512x512.png` on the Ending/Achievement screen.

**User-visible outcome:** Players see the updated scripted text for Level 4, Mini Game 3, the proposal sequence, and the ending achievement flow, including a displayed achievement badge image on the final achievement screen.
